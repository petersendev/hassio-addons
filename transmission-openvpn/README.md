# Hassio Add-ons by petersendev: transmission-openvpn

## About

[transmission-openvpn](https://github.com/haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn) is an IRC network bouncer or BNC. It can detach the client from the actual IRC server, and also from selected channels. Multiple clients from different locations can connect to a single transmission-openvpn account simultaneously and therefore appear under the same nickname on IRC.

This addon is based on this docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/haugene/transmission-openvpn.
